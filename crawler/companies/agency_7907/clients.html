                                                Ark commissioned ifour to develop their brand from scratch. They didn't want something run-of-the-mill, but a brand that would reflect their forward-thinking approach and enthusiasm for the product.

Solution:

ifour created a distinctive brand with strong imagery and zingy colours that stood out well among their competitors' communications. With the strapline 'animal surgery just got easier', we focused on the range of animals that can be treated with the product.

For such a simple, yet brilliant service, Recruitment Genius needed a brand that would not only grab attention but deliver processes and services with ease and that all important touch of friendly humour.

ifour design agency solution:

We analysed the business model, took time to understand the processes and most importantly, identified the key selling points of Recruitment Genius. The ideal solution included short, snappy statements with an element of humour, teamed up with quirky illustrations. This reinforced the relaxed feel of the business yet gave a short and easy explanation of how Recruitment Genius works. The use of key graphic elements, illustrations, colours and typography gave brand consistency throughout the implementation of everything, from website design, and social media pages to exhibition panels to print.

                                                brief:

As one of the leading suppliers in their field, TFC came to the ifour design agency with an existing brand that didn't communicate the innovative nature of their products or cutting edge breakthroughs that they support their customers to make. ifour were instructed to review printed literature and advertising and through the exploration of these existing assets develop a brand that truly reflected their position as foremost in their field.

ifour design agency solution:

The existing logo was the basis for a new, clean, uncluttered brand that uses product shots in a graphic way to communicate exactly what they sell. The brand has then developed through the advertisements and poster design with simple, punchy messaging that communicate key benefits and mark out their USPs. Brochures have been redesigned to sit within the new-look brand, whilst maintaining the high level of technical details required. Banner stands and posters follow on from the concise messaging style developed in the advertising campaign leading to a cohesive, recognisable brand for TFC.

brief:
After completing many projects for Acision, working to existing brand guidelines, we were approached to help implement a brand development across the global company. It was felt that the existing imagery and style of online and printed marketing material lacked the contemporary and dynamic edge that Acision have within the global communications market.

ifour design agency solution:
Using a mixture of light and dots (to represent the flow of data from all devices) as a graphic element across new, younger imagery and introducing strong areas of colour for text positioning, we have given Acision a flexible brand that can be adapted in accordance to the media on which it appears. The brand is constantly undergoing regeneration and we are working on many new projects for Acision.

testimonial:
"From branding to day-to-day design activities, the ifour design agency are a pleasure to work with.

From the word go, ifour understood Acision's branding requirements and have been instrumental in helping achieve some really successful design work which is always on-brand and executed to the highest standard.

                                                The ANVIL Group's corporate identity was looking a bit out-of-date and didn't give the right impression of this modern and thriving company. So it wanted a new group logo, individual business division logos and a consistent brand image that would communicate their innovative approach to delivering risk management services. At the same time, it wanted to make vendor management easier by having the companies working in its multination supply chain listed in one highly-secure site where they could be searched for, rated and manage their compliance certifications.

ifour design agency solution:
After researching the market and ANVIL's competitors we presented a range of different concepts using colours to differentiate the different divisions and services the group provides. The design was carried over into corporate stationery, marketing collateral and exhibition stands. The ifour design agency also developed a bespoke vendor management system that has the highest security credentials to improve the Group's vendor management processes.

brief:
Having worked with PCL on numerous projects previously they approached us to take on the challenge of desigining a new report for them. This time the report provides a unique grasp on human factor risk issues. Identifying individuals as one of eight Risk Types, it offers a typology and vocabulary that facilitates risk planning, research and discussion about risk tolerance. Our task was to develop a concept for the report based on the insightful content.

ifour design agency solution:
With such an interesting topic it was a great project to concept for. The final design solution was based on a circus theme. What can be riskier than circus acts? Imagery was manipulated to give a darker, more edgy feel and typography was a mixture of a bold circus-style font and clear sans serif to facilitate clear information. Literary quotes were used throughout the pages to bring further interest into the risk topic. The report features a fold out reference panel at the rear to act as a visual at all times.

                                                Established in 1784, leading London law firm, GRM have a wealth of history and experience yet come with a refreshing outlook to business. They stand their place amongst the most successful law firms, yet refuse to be one of the crowd. With a substantial client portfolio of business, international and private clients, they offer a can-do approach.
 
brief:
GRM were drawn to us here at ifour after having a good chuckle at one of our A boards. After a very productive initial meeting, they soon realised we would be the best agency to rebrand them and launch their new website as it was clear we understood what they needed and how we could best serve those needs. Although established and with a sense of decorum, GRM are a forward-thinking law firm and therefore required a contemporary identity that they could take into the  future. Working across all media, both online and off.

ifour design agency solution:
Our solution was to a create sombre, masculine colour scheme with the bright blue as a vibrant element. This retains the corporate and contemporary feel with a splash of colour.

The website is controlled by our powerful CMS system and features many jquery and html 5 elements. This is most evident on the auto resizing of the homepages and scrolling of the history pages which have become a firm favourite amongst GRM staff and clients as it's not the usual layout one would expect on a law site.

                                                For over a decade Sentinel have been recruiting people for ICT. By building lasting networks with the best technologists, no one is better placed to reach the right candidate for each role.

brief:
Sentinel approached us after realising their website did not reflect the industry they worked in or their approach to business. Specific requirements were user-friendly, contemporary, slightly humorous, engaging and colourful. Horizontal movement and the use of infographics were requested key features

ifour design agency solution:
This vibrant CMS website has clear navigation that whizzes you along the pages horizontally. The smooth transitioning takes you on a journey as you link from page to page to find branded information graphics full of colour and hidden animation all used to highlight key points of business, stats or just to reinforce the networking that is so crucial to Sentinel.

We were also commissioned to create a mobile version of the site, to enable great viewing across all smart phones, utilising the best design for the device. If you have a smart phone, take a look, we think it's pretty smooth!

brief:
Their communications needed to stand out among all the other range of collateral that bombard NHS staff every day. This included literature to promote the NHSmail service to staff across the country, as well as branding for the system delivered by Cable & Wireless and Connecting for Health.

ifour design agency solution:
Whilst designing numerous pieces of collateral to promote NHSmail we also designed some internal comms for all staff. Adhering to corporate guidelines we created vibrant posters to highlight team goals with the use of consistent, eyecatching imagery and clear copy. The same, simple design was implemented across minisites and email newsletters within this brief.

They arrange low cost business accommodation within a vibrant entrepreneurial and learning environment in one of their Enterprise Centres, providing a base to support individuals who feel they have an aptitude for entrepreneurship. These centres also create the perfect environment for charities to establish themselves, reduce their overheads and develop their own income streams, in a creative and collaborative atmosphere.

brief:
The team came to us with a great social enterprise scheme but it lacked any form of identity. They needed everything, from logo, through to full stationery pack, promotional items, advertising campaign and full CMS-driven website that they could update themselves.

ifour design agency solution:
We set about understanding their target market and what approach they wanted to take. This uplifting enterprise is all about drawing people in and offering them a helping hand with their business ideas. They needed a warm and welcoming, vibrant brand that would lend itself to all media. The logo was formed from three shapes overlapping to form an E and an F. This could also be pulled apart to be used as assets elsewhere within the branding. Calls to action within the advertising on the website needed to be clear, challenging and encouraging.

The website has clear navigation and horizontal movement to move people through the process of getting started and how The Enterprise Foundation can help. The site also features a social media feed, gallery, downloads section, and search function.

                                                Premier has been providing security solutions to thousands of residential and commercial customers for over thirty years. Offering excellent value for money and installing high quality reliable equipment to the highest standards at the most competitive prices, they combine all aspects of electronic and physical security under one roof to provide a complete security solution.

brief:
Premier's commercial brochure needed updating and it was key to take a new more modern approach to promoting the company's wide range of security products to its retail customers, resellers and end-users.

ifour design agency solution:
Moving away from the traditional industry style brochure that Premier has used in the past, we came up with a benefits and solutions-focused style brochure that focused on detailing how different product groups could resolve issues for the end-users. The success of the commercial brochure project led Premier to commission a similar style brochure for their residential products and a website rebrand and redesign in line with the new look and feel of the brochures. These projects are currently ongoing.

                                                Bakestore.co.uk is a family business run by keen home bakers who want to share their love of making cakes, breads and so on with other enthusiasts and hopefully encourage some new people to give it a go.

Bakestore's aim is to find the best products and to offer people the kind of service that they would like to receive. With years of experience baking and making at home, they understand that value and price are different. Bakestore look for great quality products that prove their worth over time, only stocking products that offer real value and pass their own 'at home' testing.  

www.bakestore.co.uk is the home of great baking equipment on the internet.

brief:
As a young start up company, Bakestore needed a brand that would communicate their commitment to quality and value whilst highlighting their enthusiastic and funky approach to home baking as a hobby.

ifour design agency solution:
The design needed to convey the current appeal of baking across several key target groups. To achieve this, ifour used simple, bold graphics in the branding and overall design to keep a fun and funky feel, while maintaining clarity and brand recognition. Recognisable baking tool silhouettes in vibrant colours were used within the logo and across web banners and advertising to highlight the key products sold. These were combined with real product shots as they were so colourful and fun, they spoke for themselves. Rolling out the design concept across the Magento eCommerce site, Bakestore products are clearly divided into concise categories for easy navigation, with an additional 'I want to make' section, for those looking to bake specific recipes for the first time. Social network platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are linked into the site allowing customers to ask questions and share their achievements with the Bakestore community. Social network pages have also been branded for a consistent, recognisable look.

                                                Inclusion is a disability consultation service provider offering high-quality, cost-effective solutions to employers, businesses and individuals.

brief:
Having worked with Inclusion previously, it was a pleasure to get cracking on a web project that would meet all their needs. Given the nature of their business it was more important than ever to include all information in a clear and functional manner, maintaining high standards of accessibility, with a contemporary but design that would not date quickly.

ifour design agency solution:
Taking the previous branding involving silhouettes, ifour developed the existing branding, adding these to collage-style imagery and exterior settings. 

On the web, large horizontal banners featured smooth movement as you scroll down each page. As the site is aimed at those with disabilities we followed WAI guidelines to increase accessibility. Navigation is simple and information is clear.

In the brochure the imagery continues with well-defined sections for areas of expertise and testimonials are highlighted clearly.

brief:
Global approached us on behalf of their Heart FM channel with the need for us to create a logo for their VIP promotion. We were also commissioned to design their welcome and listener email communications. These were to be exciting and intelligent, to push the boundaries of what they had sent out before.

After designing a number of concepts for the VIP logo, the final design incorporated the feel of showbusiness and camera flashes to reinforce the celebrity and exclusive aspect.

Email marketing concepts were on brand, clear and well thought through for maximum response.

                                                Bellhouse has a remarkable reputation as a major fabric stockist. Serving customers within Kent and Sussex and further afield, their expertise and wide range of fabric, wallpaper, furniture, paint, curtains and blinds have made them a one-stop destination for a perfect interior.

brief:
As well as an overall image update, Bell House wanted a website that truly reflected how their business had grown and the wide range of products and services they now offer both in-store and online.

ifour design agency solution:
As a long established, family run business, Bell House has a friendly, sophisticated and knowledgeable approach. We wanted to produce a website and brand that highlighted this and focused attention on their products and services. We reviewed the services they offer their customers - the products and the beautiful interiors successfully designed for clients. Using their design aesthetic as a starting point for updating their branding, we refreshed the logo, retaining their font for consistency and distilling it to a bold typographical statement for maximum impact across web and print collateral.

From stylish design consultations to a massive range of fabrics, paints and other interior design essentials, the website needed to reflect the thriving interior design destination store in Cranbrook as well as offering customers further afield a chance to purchase designer fabrics, cushions and other staple interiors products. ifour designed a clean layout with high quality imagery and simple navigation that combines the eCommerce site as an integral element.

                                                Technology services provider, Spendvision (spendvision.com) offer a platform which has helped leading banks, financial organisations, corporates and governments improve their transaction management and they handle over 100 million transactions annually for users in nearly 130 countries.

brief:
Spendvision tasked ifour to design and produce a corporate video that would be used for various functions such as presentations, exhibitions and pitches, where presenting the corporate messages in a clear, quick and engaging way is vital. Spendvision requested we use their existing brand, but gave free reign to develop the brand assets further as part of the project.

ifour design agency solution:
Developing the key corporate messages into a cohesive script and taking the existing Spendvision brand assets as a starting point, we used a combination of cityscape photography, video, graphical elements, music and kinetic typography to create a powerful addition to the Spendvision corporate collateral set.

As a global company, Spendvision required two voice-overs for different territories. ifour sourced a selection of voice overs and commissioned artists from across the world before editing the two final voice-overs into the video for greater flexibility of usage within the company. The video was also designed to have natural break points, enabling shorter sections for specific uses to be edited (introducing the company and introducing their platform) as well as intro and outro stingers that can be used to bracket other videos and presentations. These additional options create a wider variety of usage as well as offering a tool to create consistency across the brand and the possibility of an increased RoI on a single design project thanks to a carefully planned script and storyboard at concept stage.

brief:
Ifour was asked to produce a unique one page website that would stand out from their competitors. This was to serve as a placeholder until a full CMS website was to be developed. It still needed to contain relevant information potential clients would be looking for and to serve as a point of contact.

ifour design agency solution:
We produced a visually impactful parallax long scrolling one page website with embedded video. This will now be developed into a fully responsive CMS website so watch this space.

Now realising the need to be online to directly reach the consumer, they approached us here at ifour for an ecommerce site that would tick all the boxes.

brief:
Logo creation combined with brand elements that can work on the new site and promotional material. The website to be product led, clean and clear as well as easy to update. 

ifour design agency solutions:
Before we could jump to the design of the website we needed to design a new logo that would speak for the products. The block house icon made of two simple shapes can also be used as an arrow which we then implemented throughout the site. Seasonal banners highlight key products and areas of expertise. The ecommerce website features the ability to register as a customer and create a wishlist before purchase.

                                                The clever people at Redline have developed a credit management solution, which is now being used by over 25,000 retailers including big names such as Barclay's, British Gas and many in the motor industry.

brief:
The existing site was no longer representing the calibre of the product and services provided by Redline. Our task in creating a new online presence was to include a simpler, visual approach while retaining a corporate look and a credible reference point for existing and new clients. A CMS system was also must to enable easy updates.

ifour design solution:
Using an infographic style and strict colour palette, based on the existing logo, we have been able to show the product in context as we take visitors on a journey down the page. There are a choice of four finance options that can be selected to start users on a each journey and explaining how Redline's solution would work in each scenario. As web visitors scroll, the page animates into life. The whole site follows this ethos and creates a dynamic, yet simplistic approach with many means of getting in touch.

They offer media relations, public affairs, community relations, corporate communications, reputation management, event management, public relations, stakeholder management, marketing and more.
 
brief:

Having already designed Maxim's website in previous years, it was now time for a refresh. In line with web viewing trends, we offered a new responsive site design with a clean and fresh style. They asked for a contemporary site with the ability to show their history and experience within their sector and the Kent region. A large emphasis on imagery but still with the colour coding for each service sector.
 
ifour design agency solution:

The horizontal scrolling banner allows for a large selection of live tweets, news, clients and branding imagery to be viewed. The main copy is found by scrolling vertically down the site with some areas having the option to expand to see more content. The history timeline can be updated by the client and can include images, text and video which only helps to highlight the amount of years that Maxim have been in business and the diversity of their daily tasks.

brief:
When they came to us, Itec knew they had a good product in Itris but wanted their brand to be refreshed to match, needing to reflect their up-to-date technology and ultra professional service. The new website would be required to generate leads and, in its layout and information, reassure potential software purchasers that they would be dealing with a respected and knowledgeable company.

ifour design agency solution:
Itris now has a brand that matches the quality of the product, stands out from competitors and can be implemented consistently in all digital and hardcopy assets for the company. The logo was a combination of type and icon and this icon was developed across all media to create the brand. The logo is colour-coded within the training sectors to add clarity and vibrancy. The new scrolling cms responsive website has many means of getting in touch and booking a demo to increase leads.

Clients trust their sharp eye for detail and rely on their experience and professional approach to deliver top quality work.
 
ifour brief:
A new logo, a new brand and a new website were all needed to bring a fresh dimension to their business as they expand and grow. The brief requested clean, crisp, uncluttered design whilst keeping the existing colour palette in the branding for a fresher, modern feel.

 
ifour design agency solution:
With a target audience of scientists, engineers and lawyers, the AC Translations website and brand had to appeal to a professional audience yet stand out from the usual technical and b2b websites that were being viewed and can come across as monotonous and un-engaging.

We have maintained the corporate colours through the updated branding and expanding into the new logo to help aid continuing recognition of the brand. The new long scrolling website has clearly defined business sectors, the translation process and contact prompts on the home page. It is fully responsive through mobile, tablets and desk tops, all the way up to Smart TV screen sizes, meaning AC Translations always look their best regardless of how their site is viewed.

The new branding has also been applied to a corporate folder and flexible choice of inserts as well as stationery including business cards, letterhead and comp slips offering total brand consistency.

brief:
Producing a fresh and interesting corporate report annually or biennially can be a mammoth task. That is why Grundon put it into our capable design hands. They needed to engage both staff, directors and investors and offer a wealth of information and figures in both an attractive and simple way.

ifour design agency solution:
The report contains a well-laid out mixture of clear typography, photographic images and illustration. The three main sections are clearly colour coded and feature quotes, stats and key statements. The overall look is vibrant yet professional. The 76pp perfect bound report is printed using vegetable based inks on uncoated 100% recycled paper.

With an impressive array of international awards, Chapel Down is striving to push the boundaries in English wines and beer.

brief:
After keeping it a closely guarded secret for the last month, ifour have completed our mission to help Chapel Down Group secure millions with the launch of a major crowdfunding initiative.

As part of the project, our task was to create the concepts for the crowdfunding 'Share Offer Document'. This large document was to explain the whole concept to would-be-investors in an engaging and informative way.
 
The fundraising campaign by the market leader in English wines is believed to be the first time a quoted company in the UK has used crowdfunding to reach investors. The money raised will be used by Chapel Down to plant more vines, build a new winery, brewery and visitor attraction, and extend its hospitality offering in Tenterden. 
 
ifour design agency solution:
 
In the end, the 60pp, perfect bound document was substantial in content. Using revised brand assets, we developed a layout that would contain editorial highlights, pull-out boxes, photography, charts, graphs and infographics. To date this document has been a key component in the huge success of the campaign and is helping to raise in excess of ?3.95m.

Serving over 4,500 customers and an outstanding record for delivering high quality solutions. They have over 800 employees, and are based in 16 offices across Europe.

brief:
Having commissioned a large research report, Claranet needed us to evolve their Claranet Research Programme branding ready for this particular report to be showcased and printed. 

ifour design agency solution:
We presented numerous options to the Claranet team and as always, we discussed why these would work for them and how the design could be taken forward onto other collateral. The chosen design integrates infographics, copy and break out circles. Charts are clean, neutral yet clearly informative with pull out details in red. White space is abundant but broken with clear editorial and shading made of diagonal grey lines. The overall report is contemporary and corporate, just what the client asked for.

                                                TFC Europe Ltd is one of the leading suppliers of technical fastener components to the industry, with an unrivalled reputation for delivering innovative products, supply solutions, and exemplary service, helping customers achieve breakthroughs in product development and productivity.

brief:
Having extensively developed TFC's branding, it was time to work with them to create a piece of video marketing magic. Aimed at customers, the purpose of the video was to act as an explanation for all that TFC do and supply. The video will be presented in meetings, social media, web and all marketing.

ifour design agency solution:
The video contains a visual mix of typography, illustrations, animation and video footage. We discussed at length everything that TFC wanted to say and include in their video. We then went away to write the script and storyboard this in detail, screen by screen. Once approved, we cracked on with the exciting build and music choices were presented alongside developed footage. The end result is a calming, informative and unique piece of marketing material.

deliverables:
kinetic video in all formats
