They needed a fresh new website that was easy to update, as well as being attractive and accessible to visitors. CAP required a new online image that would accurately portray their inclusive, forward-thinking ethos. The resulting website is very visual, utilising strong icons and colours to ensure it is as accessible as possible to all website visitors.                                            </p>

Originally we were tasked with re designing their existing website, however this quickly turned into a full marketing campaign with video and bus advertising.

The outcome of this campaign included an increase in visitors sponsoring animals which is a vital source of income for the organisation.                                            </p>

                                                Charlotte, the incredibly talented owner of Cherry Blossom Bakery, is a former teacher who decided to leave the profession to pursue her love of cakes.

Cherry Blossom Cakes operates from a sympathetically renovated seventeenth century building in the historic market town of Bawtry in South Yorkshire, and they specialise in imaginative and bespoke wedding cakes.  Cherry Blossom Cakes came to Hydra Creative and asked us to create a beautiful new website that would showcase some of their amazing cake designs, and allow them to have a wider reach.

By using the brand colours throughout, the new site ensures brand continuity. Lots of images of previous cakes that have been created (as well as hand drawn sketches created by Charlotte) are featured in an easy to view gallery, elegantly demonstrating why these cakes are in such high demand.

Cherry Blossom Cakes is very active on social media, therefore a social wall on the new website was essential, to feed through all their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram posts into one neat area. Filters can also be added to choose specific social media channels, making the social wall almost as bespoke as their cakes.                                            </p>

                                                Brighter Futures are an independent fostering agency operating across the South and East of England providing a 24 hour support service for their foster parents.

After working with the organisation to understand exactly what they needed from their new online presence, we set to work building a bespoke website that would meet all of their requirements and really showcase the great work that they do.

The re-design and development of the website was identified by the organisation as essential in their plans to grow and develop the business, so the website needed to be easy to use with plenty of calls to action whilst also showing the positive aspects of the fostering process.

An easy to update events calendar and blog section ensures that any news can be added straight away to the website by the staff.

The Brighter Futures brand is reinforced throughout with bright and engaging tones taken from the logo, which we had previously enhanced to make the colours as welcoming and friendly as possible, and used with the aim of encouraging potential foster carers to get in touch as well as promoting the value and quality of service that the service provides.                                            </p>

                                                The National Hedge Laying Society is the only conservation organisation dedicated to maintaining the traditional skills of hedgerow management, a craft that has been practiced for hundreds of years, but is in danger of becoming a thing of the past.

The key objectives for the new website was to increase the awareness of the society, increase membership and sponsorship opportunities and promote the accreditation scheme. The finished design is clean and spacious, easy to use, and with clear signposting to the rest of the website and plenty of calls to action.

The site was designed to look modern without losing touch with the Society's earthy and traditional nature, by using muted green and brown tones throughout. An easy to use back end content management system allows key society members to update the website frequently with newsletters, events and membership information, to keep the site looking fresh and active for visitors.                                            </p>

                                                A successful market leader in mechanical services, Airmaster Air Conditioning came to us with a simple brief - create a top quality web presence that will successfully help market their offering to different target markets, increase brand knowledge and ultimately support their ongoing growth.

The key to the success of this website is its flexibility and usability, which will allow Airmaster to continue to add fresh content to the website. This has been made possible through a bespoke back end content management system, which allows staff to be able to update the website with new products, news and promotions, quickly and easily.

The new website also includes a social media wall to help keep the website updated with content from twitter and facebook. Being a forward-thinking, innovative company, Airmaster is very active on social media, so this element was of particular importance to them.

A positive user experience was achieved by including useful product and service information and plenty of calls to action. This is crucial to the website's success and should lead to increased awareness of the company and the range of products and services they offer.

Essential to the success of the new website was ensuring that the already established website rankings were unaffected, and so a robust search engine optimisation plan was put in place.                                            </p>

To keep up with the company's growing customer base of both new and repeat customers, the successful company wanted to work with Hydra Creative to ensure their new website would be easy to add to and update as the company continues to grow. The website also has plenty of calls to action, encouraging visitors to get in touch and see how they can help them.

The structure of the site was finely tuned to enhance the user journey. This was achieved by using strong icons and an easily navigable structure to allow a fluid journey around the site. The easier the site is to navigate, the more likely site visitors will be to take the next step and get in touch.

An easy to use back end system ensures that the staff at Richmond Spray Booths can effortlessly keep the website up to date with new products and offers as soon as they become available. Spending less time updating the website means that staff can spend more time doing what they do best - serving their customers.

Case studies are a great way to build a solid reputation and the new site now has a dedicated page to showcase the great work Richmond Spray Booths do for their clients. Over time these case studies will build, and with the easy to use CMS, staff can upload new testimonials in real time, to keep the content fresh.                                            </p>

                                                Croft Corner is a popular forest school nursery situated on the outskirts of Sheffield. They required a new website that would be engaging, easy to use, and most importantly for Croft Corner - easy to update themselves.

The resulting website is bright and attractive, having been designed to complement the existing branding, and appeal to the target user. The website features a blog that staff are able to update easily, to keep parents and carers up to date with activities and events at the nursery.

Also on the website is a section that contains multiple documents available for download. This is easy for staff to manage through the content management system, and means that site visitors can find what they need quickly and easily, without having to email the nursery for help, which can result in delays, as the staff are so busy.                                            </p>

                                                Karl Benz are a high end supplier of bespoke luxury kitchens and interiors.  Based in Sheffield, they required an up to date website that would fit well with their image, and attract the right target audience.

Karl Benz wanted a updated and modern feel to the website. They wanted to change to show they are affordable but a luxury kitchen company where the customer can feel they are more approachable. The logo was created with thought of a luxury stamp where it is more of a brand / stamp like Mercedes-Benz which can now be used throughout the Karl Benz brochure and showroom.

They requested that the homepage be very image driven using the high quality images provided by the hand picked suppliers Karl Benz use. They chose the most striking images from the showroom and catalogue they have.

We also developed the latest news and events section, as they regularly do cooking demonstrations and it was vital that they could promote this to encourage customer interaction.                                            </p>

                                                Dementia Carer is an ever growing online community website, aimed at offering help and support to people with Dementia, and the loved ones who care for them.  Owner of ARC, Tom, who requested this project, sums up his motivation for coming to us:

The homepage features various videos from the Dementia Carer collection, all of which offer advice and stroies to help people who are caring for someone with Dementia. We developed a section where the user can click on the videos on the homepage and watch the informational videos there and then.

We also developed a colour coordinated section where depending on the category you request information for it will define the colours of the content depending on your selection. This makes the user journey more visible and easy to see the options they have clicked.

To help the website user to be able to select relevant information easier, we created an option where the browser stores user location, gender and status, to help find the correct information related to their particular need. This gives users the chance to set up a profile without identifying themselves, and gathers the correct information from their locations and situation.  This all helps to make the experience of using the website an easy one.                                            </p>

As Rejuvenated sell products that are firm favourites with celebrities and beauty journalists, social media is buzzing with testimonials, photos and declarations of love for the brand!

                                                The Arches School Sport Partnership is a Sheffield based organisation that provides PE and sport programmes and resources to schools to ensure that children have access to a high quality, challenging and inclusive sports curriculum. They approached Hydra Creative for a complete website build, including an easy to use, bespoke content management system.

The website needed to be informative and very user friendly. The idea was to provide a space for visitors to find out exactly what the Arches does, browse through their gallery of recent events, view upcoming events on their online calendar, and fill out contact forms aimed at both schools and potential volunteers.

We built a website that provided all of the above within a responsive, mobile-friendly website. It was also important for the Arches to have the ability to update the website themselves so that they could maintain their blog easily. As part of the build we created a fully bespoke content management system and provided training to ensure that the team at Arches were comfortable in adding new content.                                            </p>

The collaboration required an agency with strong experience in web design and development, bespoke data capture, and also touch screen innovation, to be able to complete the project.  This would be an innovative way of incorporating technology within an outdoor urban environment for the purpose of encouraging fitness and exercise in the local community, and would be the first of its kind in the UK.  And so they came to Hydra Creative.

What they needed was a web application that would provide information about Lowfield Park, where the kiosk is situated; allow users to leave feedback and watch instructional videos on different ways to use the park facilities as well as activities and games to promote fitness in a fun and inclusive way. The most unique feature of the application is an automatic lap timer. Users can purchase wrist bands from the U-Mix centre at the park, to wear whilst using the facilities.  These bands use RFID technology to track lap times. This data is recorded by the application which then stores them within the online leaderboards.

Hydra delivered with a web app featuring a clean user interface for users to navigate and access the information about the park and lap time data recorded by the wristbands.

ProFit was a truly exciting project to be involved in. It gave us the opportunity to work on something unique and innovative while demonstrating a wide array of development skills and practices that we are known for.  You can try out the kiosk for yourself - it is situated at Lowfield Park, outside the U-Mix centre, and is available for all to use.                                            </p>

                                                Ringside World is dedicated to helping the UK Wrestling and MMA scene grow in popularity. It is the only website of it's kind focusing solely on UK Wrestling and MMA with no preference given to any promoter - it is here for the fans to easily buy tickets to experience this high-flying sport!

We have worked with Ringside World from the very beggining when it was just an idea in the founders mind, to now where it is the go-to website for Wrestling and MMA in the UK. The site is a bespoke e-commerce system linked to PayPal and includes secure login areas for promoters, customers and the Ringside World admin team to administer all aspects of the site.

Additional features include a bespoke UK map listing all events taking place by month and year, multiple advertising options for all promoters and a bespoke Facebook application allowing individual promoters the chance to list just their own events on their own Facebook page.

All tickets and pricing is fully customisable, with daily notifications sent to promoters to see how well their event is selling. Aside from the e-commerce aspect of the site, there is also a vast amount of information including match results, bios and much more!                                            </p>

The brochure we designed for them was very visual, using attractive images from various events that the company have supplied teepees for, and lots of testimonials from satisfied customers. The brochure has multiple calls to action throughout, including QR codes that link to the Totally Tipi website, which allows potential clients to easily view videos and more testimonials. The text was carefully chosen and kept to a minimum, allowing the breathtaking images to take centre stage and truly tell the story of Totally Tipi.

The brochures are an effective marketing tool that can be handed out at events, as well as being perfect to give to new customers who have just booked their special event with Totally Tipi.

They required a video that would effectively demonstrate how Pro Dental can help professionals with their CPD by providing approved training courses that are cost effective, and best of all, available online, which cuts down unnecessary travel and expenses incurred when attending events away from the workplace.

We designed three characters that would be easily relatable to the users of the website. Whether it's business owners who are too busy running their practice, or dental nurses who have a family, this video shows just how easy it is for professionals to fir their ongoing professional development around their busy lives.                                            </p>

The video was aimed at fitness professionals of all shapes, ages, ethnicities and sexes - not just muscle-clad personal trainers. The video was filmed over two days in various classes and the gym itself at Ponds Forge, Sheffield. The tagline 'Are You FU?' was prominent throughout this fast paced, action packed video, and evokes excitement about working at Fitness Unlimited.                                            </p>

                                                Sheffield law firm Wosskow Brown recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, so the Partners of the firm decided to create a charitable foundation to formalise the commitment the business has given to local communities and individuals over many years. Previously this had been an informal arrangement - the formation of a structured programme means that the foundation can help more people.

The aim of the foundation is 'to provide practical help, inspiration and opportunities for people to reach their ambitions.' The foundation delivers programmes of support to help with organisational development.

We filmed the video at the official launch event of the foundation, where local businesses attended to find out more information about the foundation and meet the start-ups that the foundation helps. The video is intended to promote the work that the foundation does, to a wider audience, and raise awareness to both start-ups and potential supporters.                                            </p>

                                                Wicker Camp is the oldest and most notorious Thai Boxing gym in the UK. Established and run by Arjarn Mick Mullaney & Trix March, the gym prides itself on multiple English, UK, European, Commonwealth and World titles.

The key to success in video is to be relevant, honest and useful. In the sports and leisure industry, clubs and trainers must also position their service in front of a relevant audience and provide rewarding content for their audiences.

This short documentary, produced for Wicker Camp, would double as both an informative video for existing gym trainers and an outreach to the greater Muay Thai community. In order to gain maximum coverage, it was important to produce an engaging and relevant video that would feature on many martial arts and Muay Thai websites.

Since its launch, the video has been selected by numerous high profile industry websites, blogs, social media pages, and groups - spreading entirely organically. Content marketing on this video is still ongoing.                                            </p>

Rovernighter had a 'soft launch' event, with close family and friends in the local business community turning out to offer their support.

Owner Ruth decided to capture highlights from the event, using the video to sell the features of the bag to viewers whilst driving viewers to a pre-order form on the website.                                            </p>

                                                Enterprising Young People is part of Barnsley Council's scheme to help young people aged 14-24 to set up their own businesses. The brief was for the branding to be engaging, appealing to the target audience, as well as fresh and modern. It was crucial to get the design right, as it was intended to be used in a variety of ways to promote the initiative.

The dedication of Enterprising Young People to encourage collaboration and communication between the young people it helps made us think of bees in a hive, and the strength of the hexagonal honeycomb that supports the hive to thrive. Our research into the target audience also helped us to understand what is appealing to young people, to ensure that the design is relevant.

We were also required to create a set of characters that would fit in with the theme of idea generation and business development for young people, as well as complimenting the newly created brand.

We were also tasked with designing flyers, magazine adverts and pull up banners, to be used in a variety of different settings, all of which had to complement the branding and enhance the positive message. The logo also featured on a variety of other promotional materials.                                            </p>

                                                Well-known Sheffield business centre, The Quadrant, required a major upgrade to their image, in order to portray a fresh, contemporary and exciting feel throughout all of their printed promotional material.

The Quadrant required a new brochure design that would reflect the fresh approach to customer care that the staff at The Quadrant pride themselves on. The brochure we created is quirky, unique, and not in the least what you would expect from your average business centre.

Our brief was to design graphics for an A-Frame that would captivate passers-by, reinforce the brand, and pass on information in an eye-catching and friendly way. This A-frame, situated in the entrance near reception, does exactly that, and ties in seamlessly with the new brochure.

The Quadrant required a design for a feedback system that would be attention-grabbing and very visual, in order to encourage service users to engage in communication with the centre staff. This board features a wealth of customer service information, as well as a clever integrated token collector, to encourage clients to actively give feedback on their experiences whilst at the business centre.                                            </p>

It needed to be strong enough to carry the brand forward, embody Faye's energy and expertise, and appeal to the target market of business owners wishing for support in promoting their businesses through PR and marketing.

Taking elements from both Keep Your Fork and the ethos behind Brand Booster, we created an avatar that was full of meaning, yet also elegantly simplistic. The avatar also enhances Faye's reputation as a brand herself, as anyone who knows Faye will tell you, her avatar is a dead ringer for the PR expert herself.

                                                Artisan Bytes required a new website that would make the booking process as easy and trouble-free as possible, whilst also having a contemporary, design-led feel.

The nature of the courses Artisan Bytes provides means that a lot of information is required to be readily available to site visitors. This has to be displayed in a creative way, to not be overwhelming. Breaking text up into boxes makes the content easy to digest, and makes the page more visually appealing.

This area of the site is packed with free advice and relevant information for site users, and even includes options to download free ebooks and mini courses. This all demonstrates the ethos of Artisan Bytes as a training company that is generous with its knowledge and advice.

                                                Bobby Rabbit required a new blog based website that would compliment the existing branding, be quick and simple to use, and have the ability to be expandable as the company grows.

Using quirky graphics and a non-gender-specific colour palette, the website appeals to its target audience of busy mums who enjoy buying beautiful interiors accessories for their young children. The functionality does clever things like auto selecting competition winners.

                                                Frederika Roberts, also known as the Happiness Speaker, required full branding and a brand new website, that would engage visitors and accurately reflect Fred's bubbly personality. It also needed to be clear, easy to use, and visually fit the brand.

As Fred is "The Happiness Speaker", the design of the branding took a fairly logical route. Fred was keen to incorporate a rainbow of colours into the logo to represent fun and happiness, and she also loves the colours yellow and purple, so this guided us as to the design of the lettering. And finally, a sunny microphone with the cord shaped into a smile completed the perfect logo. Fun, memorable and relevant.

Fred is a bit of a Wordsmith, and so a blog page that would enable Fred to get her personality across, whilst at the same time giving her an opportunity to share her wealth of knowledge with visitors to her website, was an essential requirement.                                            </p>

We designed the site so that crucial information about the software could be found at a glance, with the specific features being presented in bulletpoint format.

Sheffield Kitchen Outlet approached us to design their new product brochure. Their requirements were that it had to be eye catching, well laid out, and easy to use. It needed to enhance their brand, and display their vast product ranges effectively.

Not just to be given to customers to take away and browse through, the brochure is also intended to be used by Sheffield Kitchen Outlet staff as a supplementary sales tool. It has been designed to enable quick access to different areas of the brochure - made possible by using design techniques such as colour coding. Each section compliments the last, but has also been designed to portray the uniqueness of each range of products in the different sections.

                                                When innovative Sheffield manufacturer, Gripple, needed a modern, mobile friendly website that would work exceptionally well and would put them at the head of their industry, they came straight to us. The new website had to be fast and easy to navigate. It also needed a secure and highly manageable backend. This would give Gripple the flexibility to best cater for multiple markets with differing content and product requirements.

The website we created has multi language functionality for eleven key countries, as well as local distributor information for worldwide sales.

The products section has changed to improve the user experience. Each product now has more details including specifications, interactive product renders, case studies and related products and kits.  

We were also able to help Gripple with multinational SEO, by ensuring the site was optimised for Gripple customers and search engines in key territories.                                            </p>
