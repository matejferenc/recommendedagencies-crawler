                                                Based in London's exclusive Pimlico, Soane Britain is one of the UK's leading prestige interiors and furniture brands. Every piece in its range is individually handmade to order by craftsmen in its own workshops, and specialists around the country, helping to maintain skills and traditions that might otherwise be lost. 

Soane Britain approached us to design and develop its brand identity, marketing communications and website (www.soane.co.uk). As craftsmen ourselves, we recognise that, in marketing prestige products, you have to demonstrate values like quality and attention to detail, not merely talk about them. Our own love of materials filtered through every aspect of our designs for print and digital media, from paper stock and finishes to typography, illustration and photography.

Our image style is classical, in keeping with the company's British heritage, but clean and contemporary to match its global market and audiences.                                            </p>

                                                Mercedes-Benz is the world's oldest automotive marque (Karl Benz patented the first petrol-powered car in 1886). Its suitably immodest strapline is Das beste oder nichts - 'the best or nothing', a sentiment that could equally apply to our client, John Haynes Mercedes. The company is one of the UK's leading independent Mercedes specialists, offering manufacturer-trained servicing and expert restoration, as well as sales of modern and classic vehicles, for customers around the world. We spent an enjoyable time at the company's premises, talking about cars and gaining a deeper understanding of where the company has come, its current position and its long-term commercial ambitions. From these discussions, we defined a brief and drew up a project timeline.

We began by creating a new logo and brand style to reflect the genuine love of Mercedes shared by the company and its customers, encapsulated in our new strapline "A Passion for Excellence". We then translated the identity across the full range of collateral, including stationery, signage, clothing and advertising. With the company's international reputation and clientele both growing rapidly, we designed and built a new responsive website (www.johnhaynesmercedes.co.uk). We knew imagery was crucial, so we art-directed a three day photography shoot to capture and reinforce the love of Mercedes embedded in the company's DNA. We also worked closely with the client to develop an appropriate tone of voice. The result is a consistent, coherent brand identity, providing a solid platform for growth in a highly specialised and discerning market.                                            </p>

                                                Elbrus James is an executive search and recruitment support agency, specialising in the financial services industry. It takes its name from Mount Elbrus, a dormant volcano in the Caucasus Mountains on the border between Russia and Georgia, which at over 18,500 feet is Europe's highest mountain by a wide margin. From Elbrus's twin peaks, the intrepid climber can gaze west into Europe and east into Asia, which fits perfectly with Elbrus James's global reach and outlook.

The company came to us with an established but rather stagnant, safe and comfortable brand, whose look and tone of voice were very much in keeping with the industry's norms and expectations. Elbrus James wanted to refresh the brand to give it greater impact and presence, and encapsulate the principles of teamwork and shared talent at the heart of the business.

Clearly, we had to take the brand right away from the standard approach to imagery and industry-speak to make it more distinctive and aspirational: at the same time, we understood that financial services is a highly conservative sector, where being a 'safe pair of hands' is crucial and everyone prefers their cannons firmly tied down. Our approach was therefore evolutionary, rather than revolutionary; refining the logo, updating the tone of voice and redesigning the website (elbrusjames.com) to highlight the breadth of services and experience within the Elbrus James group.                                            </p>

                                                Based in Hove, Tasker Catchpole was formed in 2013 through the merger of two long-established local firms: JR Tasker, founded in 1974; and WH Catchpole, whose history dates from 1949. Tasker Catchpole's core business is public and private sector construction projects valued at ?1 million upwards: it's also won numerous awards for its sustainable buildings. The firm contacted us on the recommendation of our client Susie Pfeiffer, owner of Brighton-based design consultancy Pfeiffer Design, whose husband Stephan is Tasker Catchpole's MD. Our brief was to create a new brand identity highlighting the strength and unity within the company, and bring greater consistency, credibility and prestige to its communications with clients, partners and prospects.

We took an evolutionary, rather than revolutionary approach, capitalising on the existing equity in the Tasker Catchpole name. The new branding elevates and positions the firm as the significant regional player it's become through rapid growth and continuing expansion. It also reflects the size, nature and value of the projects it's increasingly tendering for - and winning. The rebrand included a new logo, bespoke photography, and a defined tone of voice. The new, fully responsive website (www.taskercatchpole.com) went live in December 2015, with the brand being rolled out across stationery, vehicles, site hoardings, PPE and other items during 2016.                                            </p>

                                                While a Ferrari is, of course, a truly beautiful thing, it's not just a piece of automotive art to be admired and cossetted: it's designed to be driven and enjoyed. But to fully exploit its capabilities, you need to know what you're doing. Accordingly, Ferrari set up Club Fiorano. Named after the Italian's marque's private race circuit near Maranello, it offered track sessions to UK Ferrari owners who wanted to learn to drive their machines the way the manufacturer intended, in a safe, controlled manner.

Drawing on our motor-racing experience with Goodwood Motor Sport, we applied our brandcraft to a range of high-end corporate and individual members' materials, including a bespoke fine-leather folder to hold driver literature, pit passes, car sticker and membership cards, and exhibition stands for use at motor shows. The concept proved so successful that the company now operates its own Europe-wide version, Pilota Ferrari, on the Fiorano circuit itself.                                            </p>

                                                Benchmark creates beautiful furniture that's completely handmade 'from tree to finished piece'. Co-founded by Sean Sutcliffe and Sir Terence Conran, it enjoyed a stellar reputation within the industry, but it's website and marketing did little to engage the wider audience it clearly deserved. 

Our brand repositioning focused on storytelling, bringing everything back to Benchmark's core values: wood, design, making and ecology. We updated the logo and colour palette, and developed a new, rationalised and visually-led website (www.benchmarkfurniture.com), with a consistent image style centered round the furniture in 'lifestyle locations' where the pieces were always the hero.                                            </p>

                                                The brand name incorporates the three Japanese staples forming the core menu: SUshi, NOodles and SOup. For a fusion food experience, this was the perfect marriage of form and function. The three short syllables are mirrored in our strapline - 'Slurp, bite, smile'. Rapid-fire, contemporary and vernacular, it perfectly encapsulates the sunoso offering. As a final touch, we created a series of haiku - traditional Japanese poems written to a strict 17-syllable pattern - as a light-hearted way to communicate brand messages on menus, till receipts, the website (www.sunoso.co.uk) and other items, and lend authenticity to its Asian-inspired proposition.

We managed all aspects of the branding, including clothing, packaging, and internal and external signage: to build immediate brand awareness and personality, we created a series of characters who feature throughout the premises and marketing collateral. We also acted as brand consultants on the facia and window, working closely with local designer Susie Pfeiffer, and introduced Ryan to nutritional therapist Nicola Sankey to ensure every dish is packed with goodness as well as flavour. As a start-up, sunoso had a limited marketing budget. Our expertise meant we could achieve a huge amount in a relatively short time, ensuring the maximum return on Ryan's investment.                                            </p>

The company asked us to help refresh and reposition its brand identity (and website www.harlequin-london.com) as part of a wider overhaul of its business. We ran a strategy workshop, which gave us both a complete overview of the company, and focused our minds on what needed doing (and when) and how we could help move the business forward in a manageable way.

For our refreshed logo, we adopted that most noble and instantly recognisable dog, the Harlequin Great Dane, with a chartreuse colour palette and prism/diamond pattern inspired by the costume worn by the original Harlequin, who was a court jester. We introduced a strapline - 'The interior designer's best friend' - which continues the playful theme, while sitting perfectly comfortably within Harlequin's luxury market. As part of our wider business strategy, we helped to create Agentia, a sister wholesale company acting as exclusive UK agents for some of Europe's leading luxury interiors brands.                                            </p>

                                                With its magnificent setting, royal connections and world-class racing, Goodwood is one of Britain's best-known and most glamorous racecourses. Under the guidance of owner Lord March and designer Dudley Bootes-Johns, we worked on developing the brand representation, and produced a range of cohesive brand collateral for the Racecourse. We applied the brand across a wide range of materials, including signage, posters and advertising at meetings, inviting racegoers to consider becoming members. We also created a beautiful presentation pack for the exclusive metal badges, which give access to the Richmond Enclosure on racedays.                                            </p>

                                                Swissotel Hotels & Resorts, which owns hotels in cities worldwide, operates a loyalty scheme for business travellers, weekenders and other frequent guests. As 'Swiss Club Gold', the scheme was working well, but the company recognised that the name - indeed the entire brand - was more efficient than engaging, and corporate rather than cordial. Swissotel wanted something it could own; distinctive and unmistakably Swiss that would create a sense of belonging and emotional engagement for members.

We needed to hold onto heritage and tradition yet refresh and update the entire offering. We retained the basic three-tier membership structure, but renamed them in Romansch, the oldest of Switzerland's four official languages, and reinvented them as stages in a journey up a mountain - the Matterhorn, to be exact. Thus, the entry-level became Iniza ('the valley'), the middle tier Eleva ('higher elevation') and the top level, Zenit ('summit'). Our colour palette echoed the progression, moving from green, through grey to a pale silver and white.

Our brand design was based on the intricate art of paper-cutting, which is traditional in Zurich, where Swissotel began. Working in collaboration with Swiss design studio Kessler + Kessler, and the artist Jork Andre Dieter, we created separate graphic devices for male and female audiences. We also created a circle icon for each tier, which can be arranged concentrically. These individual items can be used interchangeably depending on the communication piece, and now appear across all collateral from key rings to membership cards, and Swissotel properties.

Our brand expression is a full sensory experience - right down to the smell of the Swiss pine we specified for the top-tier membership gift box. From initial brand naming and designing the various brand elements to creating the website (www.swissotel.com/circle) and brand guidelines, this global brand revamp was a wonderful journey, and one that played to the strengths of the whole Warren Creative team.                                            </p>

                                                Focus Integration is a key UK strategic partner for American networking giant Cisco, and recognised by Deloitte as one of the EMEA region's most successful technology companies. Working in conjunction with Sere Davoudi of Sprint Marketing, we were asked to develop a new brand identity, and design and build a new corporate website. As with every project, we began by holding a series of meetings to understand the company's business approach, expectations, thoughts, wishes, likes and dislikes. In the course of these discussions, we developed the strapline 'deeper thinking', reflecting its multi-layered services that enable clients to go as deep as they need to with system integrations and hi-tech data management.

Our logo continued this train of thought. We created an abstract icon device based on a human brain, linked with a downward arrow. The slightly 'distressed' look gives it an edgy, SoCal hi-tech feel, while retaining a solidity and professionalism appropriate to its market sector. For the responsive website (www.focusintegration.co.uk), we wanted to create a definite mood and style that would help Focus Integration stand out in a crowded, dry and rather arcane market. Our solution was image-led, with a strong, consistent art direction and crop style, coupled with a distinctive colour-coded palette and font family. We also created a bespoke icon set to aid navigation. Our initial discussions helped identify key messages for our content, which is relevant and keyword-rich.                                            </p>

                                                Upmarket unisex hair and beauty salon Tommy Guns restored a magnificent Grade I Listed barber's shop, dating from the 1920s and closed for many years, in London's Regent Street. The company came to us for a new logo, website (www.tommyguns.co.uk) and complete brand identity to match its unique setting. We took our inspiration from New York in the 1920s - the so-called Roaring Twenties, when fortunes rode high ahead of the Great Depression, and speakeasies, bootleggers and gangsters flourished under Prohibition. In particular, we looked to the traditional barbershops down in the Subway, which have something of a cult following among New Yorkers.                                            </p>

Its precision engineering capabilities range from fine-limit sheet-metal cases for the IT industry, to steel construction components weighing several tonnes. Booth Engineering has a very clear sense of its identity and ethos which, like ours, is born out of a love of designing, creating and making things that look beautiful and are perfect for their intended purpose.

The company came to us for a new brand identity and, thanks to its own innovative approach, was willing to let us take the lead. So, we took the brand in a completely new direction in terms of look, tone and feel. We designed a new 3D-effect style logo, and a clean, contemporary colour palette that we carried through to exterior signage, stationery and a new website (www.boothengineering.co.uk). The previous website had been rather cumbersome to use, and the content focused heavily on technical details of the fabrication process. We designed the new site completely from scratch: fresh, clean and image-led, it captures the company's confidence and ethos, with streamlined content that's more accessible and relevant to the target audience.                                            </p>

                                                London's Victoria & Albert Museum is known worldwide simply as the V&A. The Museum asked us to compile a set of guidelines to ensure its internationally recognised brand is applied consistently and correctly across a huge range of licensed merchandise. From long experience, we know that the simpler and clearer you make the rules, the more likely people are to observe them. So, we began by taking a strategic view of the brand, defining it precisely and making it easy to understand. We then considered every potential application for the iconic global brand, including advertising and promotional materials as well as merchandise.

We established a core colour palette to reflect the V&A's heritage and global reach. We also produced complete specifications for positioning and repeating the V&A logo, and guidance on tone of voice and reproduction. We're delighted that our applied brandcraft is helping to protect and enhance the V&A brand's integrity and equity, now and for the future.                                            </p>

                                                Direct Life makes it simple for consumers and professional advisers to obtain life insurance, mortgage protection and critical illness cover at discounted prices. It's an established market leader, and gives a customers access to quotes from all the UK's major insurance companies. Direct Life asked us to develop a simple, eye-catching brand identity to position it as positive and forward-thinking. As we always do, we took time to fully understand the company's needs, and establish the truth behind its USPs and status as a market leader.

We applied our brandcraft to create a clean, simple logo device, and a fresh, modern deep-grey-and-plum colour palette that appeals to both sexes, and conveys professionalism and reassurance to B2B and B2C markets alike. The 'life made simple' strapline is friendly and straightforward, and reflects the company's offering and ethos. We also created a related logo for sister company LifeQuote, which works specifically with financial intermediaries. We're currently designing a new responsive website for Direct Life, which will be built in-house in order to meet the industry's stringent compliance standards.                                            </p>

                                                Based in our home town of Worthing, West Sussex, Guild Care provides care services for older people, including those with dementia, and younger people with special needs or learning difficulties. In its 80th anniversary year, the charity commissioned us to refresh its brand identity.

At Warren Creative, we see every branding project as a journey, and every brand as a story. We began by visiting Guild Care's properties, and meeting everyone from service users and care staff to the CEO. By gathering information and opinions, we came to understand how the organisation worked, and what needed fixing. It was a long list: the logo was outdated, the website cumbersome, and all literature and signage drab and unfriendly. Most importantly, not even those within the charity itself really knew just how much good work it did.

We needed to join up the dots, and give everyone within the organisation ownership and a sense of belonging - all within the inevitable budgetary constraints faced by charities. After presenting our thoughts to a small core team, we ran a series of workshops, getting each department involved in the brand identity process. Our final logo retained the Guild Care name and heart device, but we introduced icons varied and colours to reflect individual areas, based on suggestions by the departments themselves. This helped to create a sense that teams were individually strong, but collectively even stronger.

With unanimous support from the trustees, we refined Guild Care's 'Vision, Mission and Values Statement', developed and clarified the brand architecture, and produced brand guidelines for the in-house design and marketing team to follow. We also completely redesigned the website (www.guildcare.org), with a clean, simple design making it easy to use, and the key messages much clearer. Guild Care is a fantastic local charity, full of lovely caring people, and it was a pleasure to be involved with them. Having taken the time to really understand the organisation and get to the root of what needed fixing, we achieved a strong, united brand identity that everyone loves, and has proved a great success.                                            </p>

                                                With over 200 staff, and offices across Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and London, Henry Adams provides a complete property service, covering residential, commercial, holiday lets, agricultural land, great country houses and grand London residences. It also has a fine-art auction business. Such a diverse business needs a strong brand to unite it. Henry Adams didn't have one: each department effectively produced its own materials, with only the logo and colour scheme consistently applied. So, we began by holding a brand workshop, bringing people from across the business together for what was actually the first time. Conclusion: revolution, not evolution, was needed.

Our brand strategy brought clarity and focus. We reduced an unwieldy 20 services down to a tight, solid five, and created a new logo based on equilateral triangles. This captures the idea of all parts of the business being equally important and free to act independently, but all moving forward together as one united brand. We also canvassed customers, translating their needs and feedback into an altogether softer, more approachable look. Our confident duck-egg and aubergine palette moved the brand further upmarket, with the practical benefit that the colours stand out boldly and clearly against greenery and buildings.

We combined four separate websites into one, introducing a humanity and customer focus while elevating and cross-selling the brand. As well as showing the business's full scope, the site is structured so users pass through 'brand' pages to reach the sales details, making the whole experience more personal and less pushy. It's approachable, professional and distinctive, inspired by the simple truth that, in the end, people buy from people.                                            </p>

                                                The Kitchen Store is the sole UK manufacturer and distributer for Paula Rosa & Manhattan Kitchens, as fitted in many new-build homes, but also popular for refits due to their exceptional quality and value for money. The company has two main revenue streams: designing and installing new kitchens within Sussex; and selling additional parts and accessories online for owners of existing kitchens. The Kitchen Store had ambitious growth plans, centred around a new flagship retail store in Hove. The company came to us for a full brand audit and re-brand, to establish the brand architecture required to fulfil its objectives.

The result was a formal division of the business into two, giving each area the freedom to expand and develop without compromising the other. Based on shared brand identity style, tone of voice and messaging, we developed a striking new brochure website for the local, direct-customer 'design & installation' side, and a new ecommerce website for the national online 'extras' business. We also carried the new brand style through to the company's new retail store, creating an interior design that offers an inspiring and welcoming environment for customers and staff alike. Under a retainer relationship, we provide continuous support with advertising, marketing, point-of-sale and other branding requirements.                                            </p>

                                                In the 1950s, Jon Bannenberg set up his own firm designing beautiful, bespoke superyachts for discerning clients around the world. Six decades later, his son Dickie, and Creative Director Simon Rowell, continue to set the global benchmark for this most exclusive of luxury markets. Bannenberg & Rowell yacht interiors are all bespoke, handmade and exquisitely detailed. The company had a brand and website in place, but asked us to advise on refreshing them, to better reflect its heritage, philosophy, attention to detail and clientele.

The company had already invested in a brand identity, so to maximise return on investment, we advised a subtle refresh rather than a total revision. We also adjusted the colour palette to give the website (www.bannenbergandrowell.com) and printed materials a consistent, premium feel. The website is the main showcase for the yachts and interiors. We revisited the images, focusing more clearly on the details, luxurious materials and innovative design touches. We also developed a new navigation, using pop-out menus 'hidden' at the side of the screen. This leaves the image uncluttered and able to 'speak for itself' fully, but is also intuitive so the user can find more information easily. We then ran a series of search marketing workshops, enabling the Bannenberg & Rowell team to manage the site and content themselves, with our digital experts providing SEO support and 'sense checking' as and when required.                                            </p>

                                                Hirsh London is a family-owned jewellery business who are a diamond specialist, cutting and polishing individual gems to meet the customer's requirements. On the strength of our previous work with leading jewellery brands, Hirsh London asked us to help develop and grow its existing brand identity. Simple, subtle changes were made to transform the logo's look-and-feel, and was entirely in keeping with the brand values of precision and attention to detail. We also created a new deep-brown-and-pistachio colour palette echoing the shop's display fittings and leather wall panels, which we translated across the website and printed materials.

We also created a Google-friendly interim website page (www.hirshlondon.com), pending a future rebuild. Again, our approach was evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, focusing primarily on art direction and image style. By using existing photography more effectively, we gave the site a more premium feel, promoting greater emotional engagement with, and desire for, the products, within an existing structure.                                            </p>

                                                Goodwood Motor Sport runs two world-class motorsport events at the legendary Goodwood circuit in West Sussex. At the Festival of Speed - the largest event of its kind in the world - spectators can thrill to Formula One racing cars charging up the notorious hill climb circuit. The Goodwood Revival Meeting (held at the Motor Circuit), on the other hand, is steeped in nostalgia, with cars and costumes from the 1940s to the 1960s recreating motor-racing's Golden Age. From their inception, and under the guidance of owner Lord March and designer Dudley Bootes-Johns we've designed and produced a wide range of items for both these dynamic events, including signage, banners, advertising, posters, ticketing, merchandise, invitations and a wide range of promotional literature.                                            </p>

                                                Bolney Wine Estate in Sussex is one of England's longest-established and most successful winemakers. Created in 1976 by Janet and Rodney Pratt, its vineyards have expanded from an initial three to 39 acres. Its red, white and sparkling wines, made by head winemaker (and Janet and Rodney's daughter) Sam Linter MW, have won numerous international awards, and are sold by Waitrose and other major retailers. When we first started working with Bolney Wine Estate, we quickly saw that the relentless attention to detail in its winemaking was missing from its brand representation. By developing a set of core messages, we helped Bolney to find a distinctive voice and presence in a crowded, competitive market.

Happily, this exercise proved just the start of a long, productive relationship. Under a cost-effective monthly retainer arrangement, we've continued to provide brand focus and development service for a number of years. Specific projects have ranged from way-finding signage for the popular Tasting Tours, shop and caf? to promotional literature. We're currently developing its existing website (www.bolneywineestate.com) into a fully responsive ecommerce platform, to boost user engagement and wine sales. As our strapline says: English wine. Much better, miles nearer!                                            </p>

                                                In 1990, a London restaurant owner asked jewellery designer Annoushka Ducas to make him a set of fish-shaped cufflinks. This commission led Annoushka to set up Links of London. The company (now under new ownership) now has stores worldwide and a highly successful e-commerce business. Warren Creative developed the entire Links of London brand, including the logo, tone of voice and image style. We then carried the brand across everything from stationery, exterior and interior signage, packaging and in-store promotions to print and online advertising, the ecommerce website and a huge range of sales and marketing literature. Links of London understood that, as a global company, it was vital that it retained brand consistency. So, we produced a complete set of brand guidelines, used worldwide to ensure correct brand alignment, implementation and reproduction in all its markets and territories.                                            </p>

                                                Outdoor flat green lawn bowls is one of the country's most popular participation sports. Bowls England is its National Governing Body, with over 2,500 active clubs nationwide. However, its brand didn't reflect its status, and its website was not communicating effectively with members, or helping to bring the game to a wider audience. After a detailed assessment, we concluded that Bowls England needed a brand that could unite, strengthen and lead its entire business, not just its marketing communications. We developed a new brand identity and positioning, including a new master logo, plus comprehensive brand guidelines to ensure consistency across all messages and collateral.

The website (www.bowlsengland.com) is Bowls England's single most important means of promoting and developing the sport among new and existing players. Over time, however, it had become huge, complex and difficult to use, and we advised that it required a clear purpose and proposition. Based on our brand strategy, we completely repositioned the website, making it professional, functional and informative, yet something members could feel was truly 'theirs'. We also broke down the enormous volume of content, making it clear, accessible and easy to navigate. Through our clear understanding, branding expertise and detailed user insights, this popular, highly skilled sport now has a strong, cohesive brand identity and online presence, with high levels of engagement and loyalty.                                            </p>

Heirlooms works with private clients globally, and has longstanding relationships with the world's leading yacht builders, executive jet manufacturers, interior designers, property developers and boutique hotels.

We were asked to update and develop an existing brand identity. Our brand evolution included introducing the Union flag as a graphic device to promote the company's British heritage, and creating the Heirlooms 'H' monogram to give it a more premium feel. We created a master set of logo artworks to achieve brand consistency across all marketing communications. Heirlooms also asked us to design and build a new responsive website (www.heirlooms-linens.com). Taking our cue from the linens themselves, we created a crisp, clean colour palette, complemented by classical art direction and minimal copy. The site has a feeling of quality, craftsmanship and intimacy, in line with the company's products, methods and scale.                                            </p>

It's small specialist team, led by founder Susie Pfeiffer, providing a comprehensive interior architecture, design and project management service, creating beautiful spaces for residential and commercial clients. Pfeiffer Design approached us for a full brand evaluation and development, directed towards creating a new responsive website (www.pfeifferdesign.co.uk). The brief specifically called for large, striking portfolio images, to maximise the site's visual impact and increase its effectiveness as a sales tool.

We designed and built the site using parallax scrolling, in which the background images move past your eye more slowly than foreground images as you scroll through the page. We also created a set of simple graphic icon illustrations to highlight and differentiate the company's services, aiding navigation and user engagement. The feedback has been extremely positive.

Pfeiffer Design reported since the website's launch turnover has increased 500%. The investment was returned within 6 months of the new brand being launched.                                            </p>

Its flagship UK property is the four-star Chelsea Bridge Hotel & Spa in London, which opened in 2010. Pestana originally commissioned us to produce the hotel's launch collateral. The success of this first project led to a retainer relationship, under which we've provided creative brand support ever since. Each month, we assist with developing and producing brand literature and signage, and the hotel's every-changing tactical marketing and advertising requirements.

On the strength of this creative support, we've extended our relationship with the group, and now offer similar services to its hotels in Berlin and Barcelona. We're delighted to be involved in helping a major brand to develop and enhance its brand representation around the world.                                            </p>

                                                Like many small artisan businesses, fellow chocoholics Jasmine and Juliet started out making their 'real' hot chocolate for friends and family. Jaz & Jul's now supplies its handmade, organic hot chocolate to some of Britain's top food retailers, including Harvey Nichols in London. Jasmine and Juliet asked us to help them develop their basic logo identity, and apply all our creative and technical expertise to their packaging and label design.

The inspiration for our creative work was a quirky, distinctive take on Roald Dahl's immortal classic Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. For each of the seven flavours (among them Orangeytang, Caralimelicious and Mintchievous) we produced a separate bespoke illustration, highlighting the product's individual ingredients and flavours. The result is a fun, engaging design identity that works extremely well on each individual label, while providing consistency across the full range.                                            </p>

                                                Designer Tracey Samuel started her children's fashion house, Bonnie Baby, in 2005 after her own daughter was born. The company flourished, and its clothing went on sale in retailers worldwide, including Selfridge's in London and Barney's in New York City. However, in an intensely competitive market, the brand identity lacked personality, and didn't reflect the level of detail and care that made Bonnie Baby clothing designs so special.

Sensing it required a fresh, more structured approach to its brand identity, Bonnie Baby came to us. We quickly identified that evolution, rather than revolution, was required, and together agreed to retain its existing company logo. To take the brand forward, we worked closely with the in-house design team to create a quirky, engaging new identity linked strongly to the product design. This involved refining the colour palette, and creating a new set of brand characters. Crucially, we also drew up a comprehensive set of formal brand guidelines for all corporate literature, advertising, packaging and marketing requirements. We were delighted that this professional, authoritative manual also helped to secure substantial overseas investment, which enabled Bonnie Baby to open its first flagship store in Hong Kong in 2012.                                            </p>

                                                Established in 1985, London-based travel company Powder Byrne specialises in bespoke family skiing holidays in Europe's finest resorts, luxury summer escapes and high-end adventures worldwide.

Many of our clients regard us as an extension of their own creative department, and this is definitely the case with Powder Byrne. We designed and established a brand style for its brochures and sales literature, then set out rules covering tone for imagery, typography, look and feel for its in-house design team to follow. Over time, we've worked together on developing the design style, bringing cohesion, individuality, clarity and longevity to all the company's literature.                                            </p>

                                                Ascot Racecourse in Berkshire is one of England's premier racing venues, home to nine of the country's 26 top-flight Group I races. Founded in 1711 by Queen Anne, its strong royal connections live on, notably in the Royal Ascot Meeting in June, whose 300,000 spectators regularly include HM The Queen. For businesses, Royal Ascot is a popular and prestigious choice for entertaining key clients and associates. We were asked to review the packaging for the Hospitality Pack sent out to corporate customers by the five Royal Enclosure Restaurants.

Our initial assessment was that the presentation packs didn't reflect either the venue, or the target audience. The box was large, rather clumsy and printed in full colour, and entirely lacked the premium feel and sense of 'theatre' befitting the occasion. We designed and produced a much more refined, elegant replacement which, despite much higher production values, was actually more cost-effective per unit. Smaller and neater, it featured a blue-and-cream stock with gold foil for the logos and a ribbon within the construction. Its combination of simplicity, style and beauty gave a much truer representation of the Ascot brand. We then carried this design style over to the packaging for Ascot Racedays Tickets, used at all meetings excluding Royal Ascot.                                            </p>

                                                Our challenge was to create a logo that had purpose, added value to communications, and sparked conversations. A lot of boxes to tick, and the kind of daunting design challenge we truly relish. B&B Investment Partners is a unique partnership between principals Chris Britton and Jean-Philippe Barade with funds supported by Walgreens Boots Alliance. As well as funding, it provides management skills, processes and advice to health and wellness, personal care, beauty and consumer healthcare brands with growth potential.

B&B is a young firm with a creative outlook, and honesty, passion and professionalism at its heart. The company's branding - clean, minimal and sharply focused - reflects its approach to investment, which is efficient, uncomplicated and easy to do business with. In creating its new logo identity, we began by asking ourselves: what makes this company unique? What's the authentic story we can extract, define, build and deliver? This helped us ensure we designed a logo with a reason and purpose behind it, as well as a creative idea.

The spark of inspiration was the uniqueness of the partnership itself between Britton, Barade and Boots. We created a crisp and friendly stylised letter 'B', crafted in an approachable yet confident hand-drawn font. It also incorporates a 'kaleidoscope' window device, inviting the audience to look deeper into the company's ethos and approach. The logo and identity we designed is instantly recognisable within what is a fairly conservative market. It has scope for enhancing the brand story, while the colour palette sits comfortably within the sectors B&B invests in.                                            </p>

                                                With our substantial automotive experience and several car fanatics on our team, we were delighted when Maserati asked us to produce the packaging and presentation material for its GranTurismo. The GranTurismo is the Italian marque's flagship sports coup?. Our brochure had to reflect the power, prestige and exclusivity of both the car itself, and its prospective market. We therefore invested time in research and exploration, using creative, practical thinking to find the most effective solution. In particular, we considered how we could use materials and production techniques to create something truly special and memorable.

The result was a handmade box, with the famous Maserati logo in silver foil on the lid. Inside, we used tissue paper printed with the repeated logo in blue to wrap a beautiful leather-bound brochure, with the title blind-embossed. The perfect way to inspire the customer, and introduce them to the car of their dreams.                                            </p>

                                                Based in Monaco, Yacht Investor is THE magazine for the international superyacht market, with a worldwide readership of UHNW individuals looking to buy, sell and charter the most luxurious and beautiful private vessels afloat. As the leading title in the market, the brand enjoyed significant equity, so we looked to evolve, rather than recreate it. Our strategy was based around priorities and a staged approach, rather than trying to do everything at once.

There was a need to establish clarity and direction, and we worked on defining the magazine's personality, proposition and positioning. We then expressed them clearly and elegantly in our new designs for the magazine and website, both of which better reflect the audience and subject matter. We established a set of brand style rules, a new typographic approach and art direction for imagery. It's still a work-in-progress, but helping a brand evolve and seeing it grow steadily is something we truly relish. The website (www.yachtinvestor.com) has been transformed into a dynamic, beautiful but hardworking asset, which provides huge cross-selling opportunities. Advertisers in the magazine can use the website to present video, image galleries, floor plans and other digital material, adding enormous value and ROI to their print campaigns.                                            </p>
