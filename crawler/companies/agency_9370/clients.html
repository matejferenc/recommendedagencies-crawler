                                                SAGE Publications is a global educational publisher with 1,500 people around the world and a $300m turnover. Previously they had an outdated static HTML site that was time consuming to maintain and update. 

To coincide with their 50th anniversary, the company wanted a new site that could be updated quickly and easily; a fresh new design that would provide a better experience for their users, and the ability to localise the site for customers in the US, UK, Australia and India. As a result we have developed a fully responsive multi-language and muti-currency website with advanced search and loads of 3rd party integrations. 

Working with their in-house designers we used Bootstrap for theming to provide a fully responsive site and the new design is clean, modern and easy to navigate. The Sage team now have control over the content structure and can manipulate the menu if needed as well as spinning up marketing sections for specific promotions if needed. The books and journals can be purchased through the website. A custom checkout process was developed as there are different workflows the user can follow depending on what kind of product he is trying to purchase.                                             </p>

                                                Since 1991, Investors in People (IIP) has set the standard for better people management. Their internationally recognised accreditation is held by 14,000 organisations across the world. The Standard defines what it takes to lead, support and manage people well for sustainable results.

IIP offers an innovative online assessment platform for the new version of their Standard (version 6). Cameron and Wilding has been providing support by identifying the nature of the bugs experienced and helping stabilise the platform, transitioning to a fully lean and agile organisation and creating new digital products for the future.

Our initial challenge was to improve the stability of the platform, train IIP staff to take up the Product Owner role and support them as they transition to an agile mindset. The digital assessment and results analysis platform is based on Drupal 7 using an array of state of the art modules from Drupal's ecosystem.

It had originally been specified, designed and developed in a waterfall way. This resulted in the expectation of being able to deliver a lot in a short period of time.

IIP was looking to support and stabilise the existing platform and iteratively add new functionality. This is naturally where an agile development process really shines and it became apparent that software quality and organisational agility play really well together.

We did not have one solution to fit all problems. Our approach was to spend a couple of weeks on the discovery phase (the equivalent of a sprint 0 in scrum terms) and then report back key findings with senior stakeholders. Our aim was to have complete buy-in with stakeholders as experience has taught us that this is the most important trait for an organisation moving to an agile mindset.

                                                1843 Magazine (formerly Intelligent Life) is a bi-monthly, premium magazine published by the Economist Group, which describes its coverage as "the arts, style, food, wine, cars, travel and anything else under the sun, as long as it's interesting".

The magazine's digital presence was failing to do the print edition justice. The web, mobile and tablet platforms were not integrated, there was little aesthetic engagement for consumers and lots of duplication of effort for content to be created for three different devices.

Beginning March 2016, publisher Economist Group relaunched and rebranded its high-end magazine, Intelligent Life, with a new name, look and feel with the aim of broadening and enhancing the coverage of 1843 beyond Europe to include America and Asia.

On this project Cameron & Wilding worked with The Economist on 2 separate phases; 1. Redevelopment of Intelligent Life 2. Rebrand of Intelligent Life to 1843.

Phase 1 was composed of large redevelopment tasks, where energy was focused on optimising the structure of the website and creating a more intuitive user experience and content management. The system we built allowed the editors to manage app and web content as one. Using Drupal's flexible permission system, we developed a simple workflow to allow the team to have content published for the app, while having the ability to delay publishing to the website at a later date.

Phase 2 composed of rebranding Intelligent Life into 1843 whereby we built a fully responsive tile based layout for the website and adjusted the existing page layouts to align with the brand changes. This increased the relevance of the digital offering to subsequently increase revenue and advertising options for 1843 sponsors.

Cameron & Wilding were able to greatly enhance imagery with a lot of built in flexibility, improve security and SEO, create a more engaging user interface, develop a fully responsive website and provide a smooth transition from Intelligent Life to 1843. During the well-structured and productive project a lot was delivered in a very short period of time. The result being a really appealing website with enhanced editing tools that provide a lot of flexibility to the editorial team.

Comparing the results to the same period last year, March 7 (official relaunch) to May 19th for both years the results are the following:

Page Views: increased by 227%
Visits: increased by 295%
Uniques: increased by 263%
Reduced duplication by 80%

This means that there are many more visits to the hub therefore successfully addressing the objective of enhancing the coverage and readership of the publication. Prior to the relaunch processes took 5 times as long to get through as the same work was repeated over 5 platforms. Essentially we cut down work process up to 80% by reducing 5 time duplication processes into one streamlined process.

Key benefits of the project:
- App and web content are managed as one
- Cross-platform development
- Greatly enhanced imagery with a lot of built in flexibility
- Improved security and SEO
- Mobile first, fully responsive website
- More engaging user interface
- Smooth transition from Intelligent life to 1843                                            </p>

                                                The Telegraph Media Group (TMG) wanted to improve the stability, content delivery and design of their digital editions of their daily and weekend papers. We were asked to work with them and their contractors to build and test the new app for tablet, mobile and Kindle using Drupal CMS technology, and provide the internal team (editors) with 24/7 support.

TMG's award-winning coverage is now available in one easy to navigate mobile and tablet app. Subscribers enjoy news and opinion across business, politics, world affairs, sport and culture, plus the weekend supplements, Stella magazine, interactive picture galleries and all their favourite puzzles.

Our challenge was to improve the stability, content delivery and design of TMG's digital editions of their daily and weekend newspapers. TMG wanted a simple Drupal CMS to manage the content and workflow to feed Pugpig, the publishing platform which delivers content to the app built by 3 Pillar Group (3PG). This system will allow TMG sub-editors need be able to manually copy and paste content from the print CMS (DTI) into a Drupal CMS which will feed Pugpig.

In-depth knowledge of The Telegraph's way of working, systems, infrastructure and the product was required in order for us to be able to provide the support required on an ongoing basis.

Cameron & Wilding team used Drupal 7 technology to develop the CMS system which included code reviews and clean ups. Through extensive knowledge sharing and close collaboration between The Telegraph team and Cameron & Wilding, the app was ready in December 2015. Throughout the project, we built a strong team that developed confidence in the product.

The main key benefits of this new system include facilitating the move towards 100% of print items appearing in the digital edition - currently, we are around 93/95%. It will be extremely difficult to move to 100% because of many things that cannot work on mobile such as "classified ads", long lists or content that is just an image and not designed to be responsive.                                             </p>

                                                The Telegraph Travel Guides App promises to cut through the white noise to bring only the very best of a destination. Written by resident experts, the free app offers innovative functionality and intuitive advice.  We worked with them to build an easy-to-use CMS and user-friendly user interface (UI) that allows users to create new guides, manage existing ones and publish their content on the app.

The Telegraph editors wanted a modern and simple UI in order to replace their out-dated and time-consuming method of populating content (through Google spreadsheets), alongside improving the stability and delivery of their Travel Guides App.

We built a simple CMS and user-friendly UI that allows users (editors) to create new guides, manage existing ones and publish their content on the Travel Guides App. Content for the guides is created by resident expert writers before being reviewed and published to the app by the editors.

We greatly simplified the UI using Drupal technology without changing the app itself. We built two dashboards allowing users to create and manage a wide range of content. One dashboard allows users to create a new guide from scratch; the second dashboard lists available content such as existing guides, locations, cities, hotels, restaurants, bars, beaches, shops and more.                                            </p>

                                                London South Bank University wanted to redesign and redevelop their intranet to make it cleaner, less cluttered and more modern. LSBU's aim with the new intranet is to help colleagues easily find the information they need and help them carry out their work. Cameron & Wilding helped design and theme the new intranet, which now enables colleagues to collaborate with one another and external partners much more quickly and easily.

The aim was to deliver a simple, fast, social and intelligent intranet platform in cooperation with the LSBU development team to enable greater staff engagement with the organisation and optimise internal staff communication and collaboration.

LSBU wanted to give the new intranet a clean, simple, but visually appealing layout. It needed to be fully responsive and adhere to the LSBU brand guidelines.

The project budget and timelines were very tight so we had to make sure we made quick decisions and minimise unnecessary feedback loops in order to be as effective as possible. That approach kept the project on track in terms of time, scope and budget.

We have delivered a fresh and engaging design with a fully responsive theme, built with reusable components that are easy to integrate by the LSBU internal development team.                                             </p>

                                                The IWM website was still not responsive as of summer 2015 and they knew they needed to update it. Not wanting to overhaul their entire system we worked with them to carry our UX workshops and research, redesign and implement the frontend development.

Working very closely as one team we carried out research at the Imperial War Museum in London, experimenting with different menu structures. The challenge was representing all of the IWM sites that exist in the UK and the additional offerings and information that the museum has.

In the first couple of months we saw very positive results:
- average position in Google increased by 63%.
- average CTR increased by 27%.
- average page load time has improved by 17%.

A critical part of this project was preparing for a large scale data migration. With our enterprise migration experience we worked with the BBC's internal team to understand a complex mix of bespoke and legacy third party systems in order to construct a migration plan for them.

We successfully discovered, mapped, planned for and designed the new database for them to later carry out the migration upon completion of the new website.                                            </p>

Bearing in mind that hundreds of titles a year were being published and it was the editorial teams that wanted to be able to create these sites it was  a major bottleneck.

We created a multi-site set up with a very simple to use workflow that now allows the editorial team to create and construct companion websites for all new publications.

In the first 18 months of use it has been used to build over 500 sites.                                            </p>

                                                The Economist wanted to create 'The Economist Debates', an adaptation of the Oxford style of debating to an online audience. We helped them with the design, development and systems integration to create a user-friendly, mobile optimised solution. 

Cameron & Wilding were asked to design and develop the entire solution including the user interface, CMS and integration of numerous APIs. Strict and complex processes were followed in order to transform the practical rules of the debate style into a digital version. We built a standalone, user-friendly solution for The Economist Debates using Drupal technology. It was designed to be particularly easy to view and access via mobile devices and allow for unlimited users. 

We integrated several APIs and 3rd party services to allow for displaying sponsor advertisements on debate pages and to enable users to log in with their economist.com credentials. so to use specific The Economist Debates authorised features such as voting and commenting.                                            </p>

                                                The Economist has been publishing its weekly magazine for over 170 years and wanted to create its first daily edition. We helped them build a publishing system enabling a global editorial team to create three issues per day, which are output in a content feed that powers the app.

We worked collaboratively with The Economist editorial team to iteratively define and build the content creation workflow. This includes automatic issue creation, content approval and the look and feel interfaces. 

The dashboard contains everything needed for the editorial team to quickly and effectively create and publish issues: visual indicators of approval status, per region countdown timer and quick links to edit each article.

Key benefits: 
- A CMS that allows editors to quickly and accurately create articles and issues for three global regions
- Over 340,000 app downloads in the first month since launch
- A robust, scalable publishing platform which seamlessly serves up fresh content to more than 250,000 readers and rising, three times a day
- Editors do not need to worry about formatting styles and access by multiple users allows us to hand over controls seamlessly with counterparts around the world
- A highly collaborative and iterative product development process with the editorial team at its heart, leading to a brilliant product with very little wasted time and effort
- We were shortlisted in the Best Use of Mobile category at AOP Digital Publishing Awards in 2015.

Mencap.org.uk plays a crucial role in providing information and support to people with learning disabilities and their families across the UK. The challenge: their legacy CMS, an ASP based platform, had become outdated and a bottleneck within the web team's workflow. We replaced it with Drupal for the lack of license fees, flexibility and widespread use in the charity sector. This resulted in freeing up the tech team and allowing more departments to manage their sections of the website themselves.

Mencap, the 15th largest charity in the UK, support people with learning disabilities and their carers. Through fundraising, education, support and campaigning they help raise the profile and needs of these individuals. Mencap tendered for a supplier to carry out the redevelopment of their new website. Their old CMS was costly, difficult to use and didn't allow them to respond to modern advances in the digital world.

We delivered a fully featured Drupal site, complex data migration and a powerful donation platform, which greatly reduced costs and time taken to manage the website. This new website has empowered Mencap's web team to work more effectively by quickly creating new donation campaigns and easily managing content. Mencap's users benefit from a user-friendly design, powerful search and consistent browsing experience. One simple example of the benefits are the donation forms that once took a full day to create by the web team and can now be created in 20 minutes by one of the editorial teams.

- Web team no longer a bottleneck
- Donation pages creatable by editorial in minutes, not web team in hours
- Much greater control over the whole system                                            </p>

                                                The Economist is a weekly newspaper owned by The Economist Group offering authoritative insight and opinion on international news, politics, business, finance, science, technology and the connections between them. We worked with them to import content straight from their print platform and vastly improve the content management experience.

The Economist's annual collection of forecasts identifies and explores the worlds of politics, business, science and the arts.  The latest app provides digital access to the full content of the print edition of the newspaper.  In order to achieve speed and control, the editorial team was in need of a content management system that allowed them to independently make changes.  The CMS system needed to be updated and rebuilt quickly.  With limited time and internal resources tied up, The Economist needed to find someone with Drupal expertise that really understood publishing.

We helped The Economist rebuild their CMS on Drupal 7, automatically import content from Adobe InDesign and achieve greater speed and control over content for their digital product. Our implementation of Drupal 7 has improved and simplified the user experience, making it slicker and simpler.

The ability to import content from Adobe InDesign has vastly reduced the content production time, removing the need for time-consuming manual work.  Advanced validation prior to to import reduces the scope for human error, ensuring that the content imports perfectly each time.  Once imported, the content can be quickly tweaked by the editorial team.  Web previews of how the content will be displayed in the app make the feedback process instantaneous.

For editors, having in-house control of the content management system has transformed the workflow process.  For the first time, The Economist was able to provide access to The World in digital content before the print product was released.  There were 70,000 downloads within the first two months of launch on both iOS and android devices.  The ability to make own amends and add content independently has freed time for more elaborate, dynamic and interactive focus on digital appearance and user experience.

- Automatic content import saves time and increases accuracy
- Improved editorial experience reduces content creation time
- Web preview of app content reduces feedback cycle time                                            </p>

                                                The Nuffield Foundation worked with us to design and develop two projects. These were the main Nuffield Foundation website and the Nuffield Council on Bioethics website.

The requirements were to manage lots of online content in an engaging and easy-to-navigate way, enable staff to manage and promote content updates easily and allow for the speedy setup of individually branded microsites. We provided a redevelopment on Drupal, which allowed them to cost effectively brand sections of their educational material without the need of external or internal technical input. The flexibility provided also gave them much greater control than their previous CMS.

Within the Teachers section of the main Nuffield Foundation website the Nuffield team are able to create 'microsites' with colour, image and menu structure independence from each other, without any technical input.                                            </p>

We undertook an upgrade of the GLA's intranet from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7, so that they can benefit from the usability and security of the latest Drupal 7 release.

The GLA contacted Cameron and Wilding, who they've worked with many times before, for a system upgrade. This involved mostly backend development, including content/users import and porting the GLA theme. Their old system was not the latest version of Drupal, meaning they were losing out on the latest functionality and security.

We recreated their existing Drupal 6 site with a more stable version of Drupal 7. The work we carried out was content type creation, import of content and users, configuration of modules, porting the GLA theme, upgrading custom modules and LDAP integration for single sign on.

The testing and deployment was planned carefully as it was not possible to pause the use of this critical tool for the 1200 internal users of the system. This involved working closely with the project team and internal technical teams to ensure a smooth and unnoticed deployment of the redeveloped intranet.

GLA now has an up-to-date site that offers them the usability they need. It will offer them the latest Drupal functionality and all the available support, plus a longer life cycle for the tool going forward.

- Improved usability
- Extended lifetime of the intranet
- No interruption for their 1200 users during deployment                                            </p>

                                                Working closely with our partner organisation, Highwire, we built a content management system layer on top of their journal publication tool. This helped Royal Society Publishing, the publishing arm of the Royal Society, to update their website more easily and engage with their audience more effectively.

We were asked to produce a new and more flexible system for the Royal Society Publishing website. They were working with a dated system that was inflexible and a challenge to work with. This made it difficult to make any changes or update information.

At the time they also had a separate Wordpress blog. Having the two systems to maintain and work with was inefficient and unnecessary additional work. 

We worked with a partner, HighWire, to produce the new system for Royal Society. We put a simple to use layer on top of the Highwire Journals platform to provide Royal Society with an easy to use content management system. 
 
During the project, the Wordpress blog was re-created in Drupal so that going forwards Royal Society only have the one system to know and maintain.

The Royal Society's new site now has an easily editable CMS that will offer the administration the flexibility they need. With the blog now integrated fully into the main website, it also allows for them to save time and effort in future.

In addition, Royal Society can now make more use of the Highwire Journals platform.

- Flexibility

                                                Airmic is the leading membership organisation for the insurance and risk management industry. They needed a platform for managing large numbers of PDF documents available to members only, a powerful search function and a social network that would work for an audience that doesn't use social networks. We were able to provide a fast, flexible platform, which has given Airmic the ability to rapidly respond to current affairs and market needs, while stamping their authority within the insurance and risk market place even more firmly through closer alignment with their partner organisations via Power search.

The Association of Insurance and Risk Managers (Airmic) is the leading membership organisation for the insurance and risk management industry. Their membership is composed of senior executives who control an annual insurance spend of ?5 billion and represent most of the FTSE 100 companies.

Airmic exist to benefit its members. They do this through organising conferences, seminars and distributing research and best practices over the web. Fulfilling this mission had become increasingly difficult and time consuming due to an inflexible proprietary CMS. After evaluating several options, Airmic decided that Cameron & Wilding's proposed Drupal solution was the best platform to enable them to achieve their current and future objectives.

The main complaints Airmic received about their old site were about how difficult it was to find content. Making it quick and easy for members to locate relevant content was crucial to Airmic as they provide their members with a large amount of research in the form of reports, guides and survey documents. 

Airmic work with a range of partners, mostly large insurance companies such as AXA, Lloyd's and Zurich. These organisations have large amounts of high-value content such as white papers, reports and blog posts which are all publicly available. Airmic wanted to create a single point of contact to search through this content.

How do you make a social network for people who do not use Facebook and have little interest in technology or the web? This was the challenge Airmic put to Cameron & Wilding. Airmic hosts 12 Special Interest Groups (SIGs), many of whom have regular and successful offline meetings. One of the main aims of the new site was to foster greater online networking and knowledge sharing between members.

Airmic's new website provides a much improved way of finding content through both search and information architecture. This benefits members by helping them quickly find specialised content. The content management capabilities of the Drupal CMS allow Airmic staff to quickly create and edit content without external assistance and has removed an extra layer of cost. Finally, we have provided a solid platform for growth and innovation, which is capable of supporting new functionality in future phases, such mobile applications.

They required a system to quickly deploy new branded sites with complex ticketing functionality and multiple languages and currencies supported. In response to these needs, we developed a multi-site, multi-currency and multilingual platform using the Drupal CMS.

ATD, a large and rapidly growing company in the travel sector, desperately needed to overhaul their existing web infrastructure. The last few years had seen this company go from a small, niche player, to an established company with annual revenues of more than ?50 million. Their current site was no longer fit for purpose, creaking under the strain of growth. Adding new products, maintaining existing ones, extracting sales data and integrating external APIs took inordinate amounts of time and effort.

ne of the key factors of this client's success was branding and white-labelling. They have developed several strong brands and have several white-labelled sites, creating multiple revenue streams from several different countries.

At a high level, the requirements for the new platform were:
- A multi-site platform
- Easy to create new sites for future brands
- Content shared across the brands, but with brand-specific fields
- Separate user registration for each brand
- Different currencies for each brand
- Different language for each brand.

To determine the best solution, we did a full review of the available options, including Drupal multisite and XML-RPC between separate sites. We decided on using Domain Access module to provide the multisite functionality. Domain Access allows multiple sites to be driven from one database and codebase. Content can be shared between domains, the code is easily maintainable and only a single database is required.

Ubercart was used to provide the ecommerce functionality. Although Ubercart provides a full ecommerce solution, a significant amount of custom code was required to provide the exact functionality. This included:
- Different prices per domain
- Multiple cost currencies
- Multiple price currencies
- Different credit card options and prices per domain.

A host of other features were also developed through a combination of existing modules and custom code. These include: an affiliate system, charting and reporting functionality and an enhanced backend for booking.

The client now has a powerful and scalable platform for growth. New brands, currencies and languages can easily be added allowing the client to execute their strategy of launching in new territories, building new brands and providing white-labelled solutions to third parties.
- An integrated and comprehensive financial and sales reporting system
- A powerful, scalable web platform that supports multiple brands, currencies and languages
- Ability to provide white label solutions to third parties                                            </p>

                                                We worked with Codeignitor and Drupal in order to integrate 14 different ticketing systems and multiple feeds to sell tickets and produce band profiles on the website. Codeignitor consumed the feeds, which were then pushed to the Drupal website. We also did integration work with the Facebook API in order to reduce the effort in signing up to Livemusic. If users used Facebook they were able to auto populate their Livemusic profile with their music likes and basic information from their Facebook profile.

The IFST wanted to grow from 2,000 industry members and students to 15,000, which would add greater weight to their lobbying and more gravitas to the organisation. The old website was dated, with lots of old content, an old design and the system it is built on was inflexible and challenging to update and maintain.

This project involved redesign and development of the IFST website and integration with their CRM system.
Unifying these functions and creating an extendable and manageable content management system provided a series of benefits, including:

- A fresh new design - incorporating personalisation and possibly mobile
- Greater efficiency in management of the website
- A smooth user experience for all users of the website
- Better analytics from the new system
- Greater opportunity for innovation
- Smooth workflows for the IFST team
