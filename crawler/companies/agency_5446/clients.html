We employed a number of high impact, large scale advertising strategies to generate excitement and enthusiasm around the launch of Lines 2 and 3 of the network, taking advantage of opportunities across all media.                                            </p>

                                                Earlier this week Champions UK (plc) won another large account with Multi Cig - a Leicestershire based e-cigarette company. We proposed a fully managed brand strategy including all aspects of their marketing and PR, aimed to cement multiCIG as the UK's leading manufacturer of high quality e-cigarettes. To follow a successful 12 months of PR activity, we proposed large scale targeted marketing activity to work with and complement the increased brand awareness. The individual marketing activities proposed within our agreement have been designed to reach key areas of the target consumer demographic, using a series of creative concepts and industry leading insights to establish and reaffirm the positioning of the brand.
A mixture of Online Marketing , Online Advertising, Marketing Collateral, Advertising Strategy, Exhibitions and Public Awareness are amongst the tools in our arsenal we have proposed to make this brand a real success story!

                                                Champions (UK) plc Launched a new brand from scratch for a fish and chips restaurant in Henley in Arden. We created a striking and original brand for the restaurant. The brand is powerful and strong and immediately conveys what customers can expect from this family-friendly fish and chip restaurant. We then adapted this into the design for the restaurant's sign and its menu, creating a full visual brand identity for Finest Catch. We also handled all visual aspects of the interior of the restaurant, creating a sense of brand theatre drawing on inspiration from American diners and retro styled things such as Juke boxes and traditional Coca Cola bottles. Following the branding, Finest Catch has become on the region's most popular and successful restaurant and has enjoyed excellent critical acclaim.

Our success with this has lead to our working on a second restaurant opening in Tipton nr Birmingham, and following the success with this second job, we can only hope for a third!                                             </p>

                                                Champions (UK) plc developed and commissioned an innovative concept for a high profile DIY television series on UKTV Home featuring Craig Phillips. The programme was designed to offer something different in the DIY market, build the profile of Craig Phillips as UK's leading Celebrity DIY expert and increase ratings on UKTV Home.

We developed and commissioned two major television series for Craig Phillips on UKTV Home. 'Celebrity DIY with Craig Phillips' successfully aired on UKTV Home in 2010. The show featured Craig Phillips alongside major international celebrities including Uri Geller, Linda Robson, Chesney Hawkes, Sam Fox and many more as he visited their homes to show them how to fix those annoying odd jobs that pile up, even in the homes of the rich and famous. In addition to this, we also successfully commissioned the series, 'If it's Broke, Fix it', spreading DIY tips and enthusiasm across the nation during the show's unique format. This commission has resulted in successful spin-off projects, including a unique iPad application and other television series commissions for Craig and UKTV Home.                                             </p>

                                                Champions (UK) plc manage all visual aspects of the launch of a new biannual luxury lifestyle magazine in the West Midlands. Our creative department was tasked with developing a complete "look" and "style" for the publication, including branding, cover design, feature design, advertising design and promotions design.

We developed stylish and eye-catching designs for the magazine's format and branding, incorporating the entirety of the publication, literally from "cover to cover". Securing an effective typeface and an impressive visual identity, we decided to keep it simple, using a quality palette of grey, white and black. While providing visual interest and impact, this approach allowed the features, articles and photography to take centre-stage. 

We have to work closely with all of our advertisers to ensure that their features and advertorials make the biggest impact within the publication. In order to achieve this, we rigorously control all aspects of the photography and imagery throughout the magazine, to ensure it is of a high standard and captures the ethos of the publication. Lavish design standards and attention to detail are employed throughout the magazine. One of the most important aspects of the design of any publication is its cover. Champions (UK) plc design the cover for each issue of the magazine around a hugely successful star, in order to set it apart from competing publications. Cover stars have included Kate Beckinsale and Julia Roberts among others.                                             </p>

                                                Champions (UK) plc design and create all visual aspects and imagery for the East Midlands' leading luxury lifestyle publication: Aspirational Magazine, with a circulation of 75,000. The design across the whole magazine had to be consistent and was intended to epitomise the editor's ultra high quality and stylish aesthetic.

The creative studio at Champions (UK) plc developed comprehensive visual branding for the biannual Aspirational Magazine and extended this across all aspects of the publication, both internal and external. The process began by generating ideas for a logo that would convey the magazine's core values: luxury, quality and style. The design we developed was contemporary and stylish, incorporating the "a" of Aspirational into a sphere. Working closely alongside our partners, we secured an effective logo and developed consistent style, font and imagery to be used across all sections of the magazine: editorial, contents, lifestyle pages, business pages and social pages, etc. We had to ensure that there was the right amount of variation to maintain interest across the publication, while also having visual coherence.

The design we developed is simple and uncluttered, using a bold palette of black and white for the magazine's framework such as contents page and editorial details, in order to let the high quality photography and imagery of the features stand out. We also generate new and fresh cover designs for every issue of the magazine and undertake the design of many of the advertising and features in order to ensure a consistently high quality. We have featured some of the most iconic stars in the world on our covers, including Elisabeth Taylor, Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz and Twiggy. We adapted the Aspirational Magazine imagery and branding into highly effective sales tools for the publication's sales executives to make use of when they are meeting potential advertisers. These tools immediately convey the quality of the magazine. In addition to this, we developed custom display units for the magazine to be distributed at some of the region's leading luxury and business events.                                             </p>
